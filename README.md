# About just-domains_web_malwaredomains.com

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dead-hosts/just-domains_web_malwaredomains.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dead-hosts/just-domains_web_malwaredomains.com)

A list of domains that are known to be used to propagate malware are listed in Bind and Windows zone files. The domains are loaded onto an internal DNS server. When a computer requests a URL or file from one of these domains, a fake reply is sent, thus preventing many malware installs from occuring.

# About Dead-hosts

[Dead-Hosts](https://github.com/dead-hosts) is the replacement of the original idea behind [funilrys/dead-hosts](https://github.com/funilrys/dead-hosts).
Indeed, the idea was to test - with the help of PyFunceble and Travis CI - hosts file, list of domains or even bocklist to have a list of only active domains or IP.

Today, we provide our infrastructure for anybody who want it. [Just ask](https://github.com/dead-hosts/dev-center/issues/new?template=inclusion-request.md)!
